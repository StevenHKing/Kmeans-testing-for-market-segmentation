# Kmeans-testing-for-market-segmentation
K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for market segmentation. It finds natural clusters in customer data by minimizing within-group differences and maximizing between-group differences. I understand how to implement it in R, evaluate the optimal number of clusters, and interpret the results for marketing strategy.
