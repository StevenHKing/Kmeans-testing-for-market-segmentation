# Kmeans-testing-for-market-segmentation
K-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for market segmentation. It finds natural clusters in customer data by minimizing within-group differences and maximizing between-group differences. I understand how to implement it in R, evaluate the optimal number of clusters, and interpret the results for marketing strategy.

# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This repo contains R code from my MGT 100 (Consumer Analytics) coursework at UC San Diego.

The goal is to identify customer segments based on behavioral data using the K-means algorithm.
